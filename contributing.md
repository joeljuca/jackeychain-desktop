## How we kanban: understanding our Trello board

This project is managed with a Trello board with four columns, each one
representing a state of tasks, represented by Trello cards:

- **Backlog**  
  New tasks are always created here. Every project task will be here until it's
  moved to the Sprint column;  
- **Sprint**  
  Tasks included in the Sprint column must be finished before the sprint
  deadline;  
- **In progress**  
  Started tasks will reside here. They must be assigned to the responsible
  contributor;  
- **Done**  
  Finished tasks that are ready to deploy will reside here.
